		<title>Cloud Computing</title>
		<para>Cloud computing is a computing model, where resources such as computing power, storage, network and software are abstracted and provided as services on the internet in a remotely accessible fashion. Billing models for these services are generally similar to the ones adopted for public utilities. On-demand availability, ease of provisioning, dynamic and virtually infinite scalability are some of the key attributes of cloud computing.</para>
		<para>An infrastructure setup using the cloud computing model is generally referred to as the "cloud". The following are the broad categories of services available on the cloud:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</para></listitem>

		<title>OpenStack</title>
		<para>OpenStack is a collection of open source software projects that enterprises/service providers can use to setup and run their cloud compute and storage infrastructure. Rackspace and NASA are the key initial contributors to the stack. Rackspace contributed their "Cloud Files" platform (code) to power the Object Storage part of the OpenStack, while NASA contributed their "Nebula" platform (code) to power the Compute part.  OpenStack consortium has managed to have more than 150 members including Canonical, Dell, Citrix etc.</para>

<section xml:id="Open_Stack_Compute_Infrastructure_Nova_-d1e124">
		<title>Open Stack Compute Infrastructure (Nova)</title>
		<para>Nova is the Computing Fabric controller for the OpenStack Cloud. All activities needed to support the life cycle of instances within the OpenStack cloud are handled by Nova. This makes Nova a Management Platform that manages compute resources, networking, authorization, and scalability needs of the OpenStack cloud. But, Nova does not provide any virtualization capabilities by itself; instead, it uses libvirt APIs to interact with the supported hypervisors. Nova exposes all its capabilities through a web services API that is compatible with the EC2 API of Amazon Web Services.</para>

		<title>API Server (nova-api)</title>
		<para>The API Server provides an interface to the outside world to interact with the cloud infrastructure. API server is the only component that the outside world uses to manage the infrastructure. The management is done through web services calls using EC2 API. The API Server then, in turn, communicates with the relevant components of the cloud infrastructure through the Message Queue. As an alternative to EC2 API, OpenStack also provides a native API called "OpenStack API".</para>

		<title>Compute Worker (nova-compute)</title>
		<para>Compute workers deal with instance management life cycle. they receive the requests for life cycle management via the Message Queue and carry out operations. There are several Compute Workers in a typical production cloud deployment. An instance is deployed on any of the available compute worker based on the scheduling algorithm used.</para>

        <para>The scheduler maps the nova-API calls to the appropriate openstack components. It runs as a daemon named nova-schedule and picks up a compute server from a pool of available resources depending upon the scheduling algorithm in place. A scheduler can base its decisions on various factors such as load, memory, physical distance of the availability zone, CPU architecture, etc. The nova scheduler implements a pluggable architecture.</para>
        <para>Currently the nova-scheduler implements a few basic scheduling algorithms:</para>

		<para>Swift provides a distributed, eventually consistent virtual object store for OpenStack. It is analogous to Amazon Web Services - Simple Storage Service (S3). Swift is capable of storing billions of objects distributed across nodes. Swift has built-in redundancy and failover management and is capable of archiving and media streaming. It is extremely scalable in terms of both size (several petabytes) and capacity (number of objects).</para>

	<title>Swift Proxy Server</title>
	<para>The consumers interact with the Swift setup through the proxy server using the Swift API. The proxy server acts as a gatekeeper and recieves requests from the world. It looks up the location of the appropriate entities and routes the requests to them. </para>
	<para>The proxy server also handles failures of entities by rerouting requests to failover entities (handoff entities)</para>
	</section>

<section xml:id="Swift_Object_Server-d1e291">
	<title>Swift Object Server</title>
	<para>The Object server is a blob store. It's responsibility is to handle storage, retrieval and deletion of objects stored in the local storage. Objects are typically binary files stored in the filesystem with metadata contained as extended file attributes (xattr).</para>
 
	<para>Note: xattr is supported in several filesystems such as ext3, ext4, XFS, Btrfs, JFS and ReiserFS in Linux. But it is known to work best under XFS, JFS, ReiserFS, Reiser4, and ZFS. XFS is considered to be the best option.</para>

	<title>The Ring</title>
	<para>The ring contains information about the physical location of the objects stored inside Swift. It is a virtual representation of mapping of names of entities to their real physical location. It is analogous to an indexing service that various processes use to lookup and locate the real physical location of entities within the cluster. Entities like Accounts, Containers, Objects have their own seperate rings.</para>

<section xml:id="Openstack_Identity_server-d1e325">
	<title>OpenStack Identity Service (Keystone)</title>
    <para>Keystone provides identity and access policy services for all components in the OpenStack family. It implements it's own REST based API (Identity API). It provides authentication and authorization for all components of OpenStack including (but not limited to) Swift, Glance, Nova. Authentication verifies that a request actually comes from who it says it does. Authorization is verifying whether the authenticated user has access to the services he/she is requesting for.</para>

    <para>
Volume services are used for management of LVM-based instance volumes. Volume services perform volume related functions
such as creation, deletion, attaching a volume to an instance, and detaching a volume from an instance. Volumes provide a way
of providing persistent storage for the instances, as the root partition is non-persistent and any changes made to it are lost when
an instance is terminated. When a volume is detached from an instance or when an instance, to which the volume is attached, is
terminated, it retains the data that was stored on it. This data can be accessed by re-attaching the volume to the same instance or
by attaching it to other instances.
	</para>
	<para>
Critical data in an instance must always be written to a volume, so that it can be accessed later. This typically applies to the
storage needs of database servers etc.

   <title>Message Queue (Rabbit MQ Server)</title>
   <para>The OpenStack Cloud Controller communicates with other nova components such as the Scheduler, Network Controller, and Volume Controller via AMQP(Advanced Message Queue Protocol). Nova uses asynchronous calls for request response, with a call-back that gets triggered once a response is received. Since asynchronous communication is used, none of the user actions get stuck for long in a waiting state. This is especially true since many actions expected by the API calls such as launching an instance or uploading an image are time consuming.</para>
